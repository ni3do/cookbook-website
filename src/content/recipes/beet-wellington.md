## Ingredients

- `4` cooked beets (Randen)
- `1` sheet puff pastry (320g)
- `2 tbsp` coarse mustard

## Filling:

- `30g` dried porcini mushrooms
- `2` shallots
- `2` cloves garlic
- `500g` champignons
- `1 bunch` parsley
- `500g` thawed spinach
- oil
- salt and pepper to taste
- (optional: sesame seeds for topping)
- (optional: egg yolk or plant-based alternative for brushing)

## Steps

1. Soak dried porcini mushrooms in lukewarm water for about 20 minutes. Finely chop shallots, garlic, champignons, and parsley. Remove soaked mushrooms, squeeze out excess water, and chop finely. Squeeze spinach well and chop finely.
2. Heat oil in a pan. Sauté shallots and garlic until translucent. Add mushrooms and cook for about 10 minutes until all the liquid evaporates. Add spinach and parsley and mix well. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Let the filling cool.
3. Peel the beets. Roll out puff pastry. Spread mustard on one half, leaving about a 3cm border free. Add a little mushroom filling onto the mustard side. Place beets tightly next to each other on top of the filling.
4. Spread remaining filling over and around the beets, pressing gently. Fill any gaps with extra filling.
5. Using the baking paper, tightly roll the pastry over the beets. Seal the edges well. Place the Wellington seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Chill for about 30 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 200°C (top/bottom heat). Brush pastry with egg yolk or alternative. Decorate with pastry strips or score lightly if desired. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if using.
7. Bake the Beet Wellington in the middle of the oven for about 30 minutes. Remove and let rest briefly before slicing carefully and serving.
