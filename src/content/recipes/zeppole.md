- `100ml` water
- `100ml` milk
- `100g` butter
- `1 tsp` sugar
- pinch salt
- `105g` all-purpose flour
- `4` eggs

## Steps

1. In a saucepan combine milk, water, butter, sugar, and salt.
2. Bring just to a boil on medium heat.
3. Remove from heat and stir in the flour.
4. Once incorporated, place back on heat.
5. Stir constantly for 1–2 minutes to partially cook the flour.
6. Dough should come together in a smooth ball.
7. Transfer to a bowl and mix with an electric mixer for 1 minute to cool down.
8. Add eggs one at a time, fully incorporating each before adding the next.
9. Beat another minute until dough is smooth and forms a thick ribbon when pulled up.
10. Transfer into a piping bag and pipe onto a baking sheet.
11. Avoid making tips; if any form, smooth them out.
12. Bake at 220°C for 10 minutes.
13. Reduce to 160°C without opening the oven, and bake for another 20–22 minutes or until golden brown.
