## Ingredients
- `250g` wheat flour  
- ½ packet dry yeast (approx. 3.5g)  
- ¼ tsp sugar  
- `165ml` lukewarm water (approximate)  
- ½ tbsp olive oil or rapeseed oil  
- ¾ tsp salt (leveled)  

## Steps
1. In a large bowl, mix flour, yeast, and sugar.  
2. Add lukewarm water, oil, and salt. Mix and knead for about 5 minutes into a firm, smooth yeast dough.  
3. Cover and let rest in a warm place for about 1 hour until doubled in size.  
4. Transfer dough to a floured surface, knead briefly and gently. Divide into 10 equal portions and shape each into a ball.  
5. Flatten each ball slightly by hand and roll out into 0.5cm thick rounds, roughly 14–16cm in diameter.  
6. Place on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Cover and let rise for another 20 minutes.  
7. Preheat oven to 250°C (top and bottom heat).  
8. Bake the first tray for about 7 minutes. Do not open the oven door. Once puffed up, remove immediately so they stay light in color.  
9. Repeat with the second tray.  

## Notes
- To keep the pita soft, wrap immediately after baking in a plastic bag or kitchen towel to retain steam.  
- If storing, place warm bread in freezer bags and freeze right away.  
- For well-puffed pita pockets: ensure well-proofed dough, roll thin (max 0.5cm), and use very high heat with a properly preheated oven.  
- If using the bread for dipping instead of filling, roll it thicker, bake at lower temperature for longer.
