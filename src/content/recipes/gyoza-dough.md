## Ingredients
- `240g` all-purpose flour  
- ½ tsp salt  
- `120ml` hot water (plus more as needed)  
- Cornstarch (for dusting)  

## Steps
1. Sift the flour into a large bowl.  
2. Add the salt to the just-boiled hot water and stir until completely dissolved.  
3. Add the hot water to the flour, a little at a time, stirring with a rubber spatula. Mix until the flour and water are completely combined. If needed, add more hot water, ½ tablespoon at a time, until the dough can be formed into a ball. *(Tip: Different brands of flour absorb water differently; you may need 120–150 ml.)*  
4. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead for 10 minutes.  
5. After kneading, the dough should be much smoother. Use a dough scraper to cut the ball of dough in half.  
6. Shape each half into a long log about 1½ inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. Wrap each log with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.  

## Rolling and Cutting the Wrappers
1. After resting, cut each log into small pieces, roughly 10–12g each.  
2. Dust your work surface and rolling pin with cornstarch.  
3. Roll each piece into a ball, then flatten it into a small disc.  
4. Using a rolling pin, roll each disc out into a thin, round wrapper about 8–9 cm (3–3.5 inches) in diameter. Keep the center slightly thicker than the edges if possible.  
5. Stack finished wrappers with a light dusting of cornstarch between each to prevent sticking.
