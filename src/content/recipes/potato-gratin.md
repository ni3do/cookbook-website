## Ingredients
- `200ml` heavy cream  
- `1` garlic clove  
- `15g` butter  
- `600g` starchy potatoes  
- `125g` gruyere cheese  
- `1` thyme leaf  
- salt  
- pepper  

## Steps
1. Place butter, cream and garlic in a jug. Mix until combined.  
2. Peel the potatoes and slice them 3mm thick.  
3. Spread 1/3 of the potatoes in a baking dish, then pour over 1/3 of the cream mixture, scatter with 1/3 of the salt, pepper, and thyme. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup cheese.  
4. Repeat for the 2nd and third layer, but **do not finish with cheese** on the top layer (will add later).  
5. Cover with lid or foil, and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes or until the potatoes in the middle are soft (use a knife to test); it might take up to 1½ hours.  
6. Remove foil, top with cheese. Bake for a further 10 to 15 minutes until golden and bubbly. Stand 5 minutes before serving.
