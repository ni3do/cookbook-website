## Ingredients
- `265g` lightly toasted sugar  
- `1g` salt  
- `565g` whole milk  
- `225g` heavy cream  

## Steps
1. Mix 70% of the milk (400g) with the sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat until it simmers. When the mixture comes to a boil, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute.  
2. Immediately transfer mixture to a large bowl, then whisk in the remaining milk and cream. Bearing in mind that the gelato will taste substantially less sweet once frozen, season with an additional pinch of salt, if desired.
