## Ingredients

## For the Sponge
- `6` eggs  
- `200g` sugar  
- `200g` flour  
- `50g` cornstarch  
- `50g` cocoa powder  
- `2 tsp` baking powder  
- Butter, for greasing the pan  

## For the Filling
- `1` jar sour cherries (drained weight: 350g)  
- `2 tbsp` cornstarch  
- 1L heavy cream  
- `5` packets whipped cream stabilizer  
- `1 tbsp` sugar  
- `9 tbsp` kirsch (cherry brandy)  
- `100g` chocolate shavings  

## Steps

## Step 1: Prepare the Sponge
1. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan: 160°C).  
2. In a mixing bowl, beat 6 eggs with 200g sugar and 6 tbsp water for about 5 minutes until doubled in volume.  
3. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and baking powder.  
4. Gradually sift the dry mixture into the egg mixture and gently fold in.  
5. Grease and lightly flour a 26cm springform pan. Pour in the batter and smooth it out.  
6. Bake for about 20 minutes. Let the sponge cool completely.  

## Step 2: Prepare the Cherry Filling
1. Drain the cherries, reserving the juice.  
2. Stir 2 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp of the cherry juice.  
3. Bring the remaining juice to a boil, stir in the starch mixture, and briefly boil while stirring. Remove from heat.  
4. Set aside 16 cherries for decoration. Stir the rest into the cherry mixture.  

## Step 3: Assemble the Cake
1. Slice the sponge twice horizontally to create three layers.  
2. Place the first layer on a cake plate and drizzle with 3 tbsp kirsch.  
3. Spread the cherry filling evenly on top and let cool.  
4. Whip the cream with stabilizer and sugar until stiff.  
5. Spread about 3 tbsp of whipped cream thinly over the cherry layer.  

## Step 4: Finish and Decorate
1. Place the second sponge layer on top, press lightly, and drizzle with 3 tbsp kirsch.  
2. Spread half of the remaining cream on top.  
3. Place the final sponge layer on top and soak with the remaining kirsch.  
4. Cover the entire cake with the rest of the cream.  
5. Pipe 16 cream rosettes on top using a piping bag with a star nozzle.  
6. Place one cherry on each rosette.  
7. Sprinkle chocolate shavings over the top and sides.  
8. Chill until ready to serve.  

## Notes
- Sifting the dry ingredients helps maintain a light, airy batter.  
- Use high-quality kirsch for the best flavor.  
- Let the cake chill at least 2–3 hours before serving for best texture.
