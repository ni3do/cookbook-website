## Ingredients

- `200g` beef fillet
- `100g` mushrooms
- `100g` puff pastry
- thyme sprig
- `2` slices parma ham
- `1` egg yolk
- olive oil
- `1` shallot
- `3` black peppercorns
- `1` bay leaf
- splash red wine vinegar
- `200ml` red wine
- `200ml` beef stock

## Steps

1. Wrap beef tightly in cling film to set shape, then chill overnight.
2. Sear beef fillets in a hot pan for 30–60 seconds until browned all over but rare in the middle.
3. Finely chop mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with olive oil, thyme leaves, and some seasoning.
4. When mushrooms release their juices, continue to cook on high heat for 10 minutes until all excess moisture has evaporated.
5. Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place parma ham slices in the middle, overlapping slightly.
6. Spread the duxelle evenly over the ham.
7. Season the beef fillets and place them on the mushroom-covered ham.
8. Roll the parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film.
9. Let chill for at least 30 minutes.
10. Brush the pastry with egg wash.
11. Wrap pastry around the parma-wrapped fillets.
12. Trim the pastry and brush with egg wash all over.
13. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.
14. Heat oil in a pan, add some meat fat. Add shallots, peppercorns, bay, and thyme and cook for about 5 minutes.
15. Pour in the vinegar and let bubble for a few minutes until almost dry.
16. Add the wine and boil until almost completely reduced.
17. Add the stock and bring to a boil again.
18. Lower heat and simmer gently for 1 hour.
19. Strain through a fine sieve.
20. Score the pastry of the beef wellingtons lightly and brush with egg wash again.
21. Bake at 200°C for 15–20 minutes.
22. Rest for 10 minutes before carving.
