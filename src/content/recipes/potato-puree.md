## Ingredients

- `500g` Yukon Gold potatoes
- `225g` butter
- `30g` milk

## Steps

1. Place unpeeled potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water.
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a rapid simmer and cook for 35–40 minutes until fully tender.
3. Peel the cooked potatoes while still warm.
4. Mash the potatoes through a food mill on the finest setting, back into the cooking pot.
5. Heat the pot over medium heat, stirring the mash until steam begins to rise.
6. Gradually add the butter in multiple additions, letting each portion melt almost completely before adding the next.
7. Stir in the warm milk until fully combined.
8. Vigorously whisk the puree until light, fluffy, and ultra-smooth.
