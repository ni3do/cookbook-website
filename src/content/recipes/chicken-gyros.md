## Ingredients

## Chicken Marinade

- `2 lb` / 1 kg chicken thigh fillets, boneless skinless
- `3` large garlic cloves, minced (~3 tsp)
- `1 tbsp` white wine vinegar (or red wine or apple cider vinegar)
- `3 tbsp` lemon juice
- `1 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil
- `3 tbsp` Greek yogurt, preferably full fat
- 1½ tbsp dried oregano
- `1 tsp` salt
- Black pepper, to taste

## Tzatziki

- `2` cucumbers (to yield ½–¾ cup grated cucumber after squeezing out juice)
- 1¼ cups Greek yogurt, preferably full fat
- `1 tbsp` lemon juice
- `1 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil (more if you want it richer)
- `1` garlic clove, minced
- ¼ tsp salt
- Black pepper, to taste

## To Serve

- `4` to 6 [[pita-bread|Pita Breads]] or flatbreads

## Steps

## Marinate Chicken

1. Place all marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag and massage to mix.
2. Add chicken to the bag and massage to coat thoroughly.
3. Marinate for at least 2 hours (preferably 3 hours, ideally 12; max 24 hours).

## Make Tzatziki

1. Cut cucumbers in half lengthwise and scrape out watery seeds.
2. Coarsely grate using a box grater. Wrap in paper towels or a tea towel and squeeze to remove excess liquid.
3. Combine cucumber with remaining tzatziki ingredients and mix well.
4. Let sit for at least 20 minutes for flavors to meld.

## Cook Chicken

1. Brush grill with oil and preheat on medium-high, or heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
2. Remove chicken from marinade and cook for 2–3 minutes per side, until golden and cooked through.
3. Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil, and rest for 5 minutes.

## Assemble Gyros

1. If chicken thighs are large, slice as needed.
2. Warm pita or flatbread. Place on parchment or foil.
3. Add cooked chicken and tzatziki.
4. Wrap and twist parchment to secure.
