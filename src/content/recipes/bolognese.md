## Ingredients
- `1` medium onion  
- `1` celery stalk  
- `1` small carrot  
- `3 tbsp` olive oil  
- `450g` ground beef (20% fat)  
- `90g` pancetta  
- `250ml` dry white wine  
- `75g` tomato paste  
- `1` bay leaf  
- pinch of nutmeg  
- `500ml` chicken stock  
- `250ml` milk  
- `60g` parmesan, plus more for serving  
- `450g` pasta (parpadelle or tagliatelle)  

## Steps
1. Pulse onion, celery, and carrot in a food processor until very finely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl.  
2. Heat oil in a pot or Dutch oven. Break beef into small clumps and add to pot, season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally but not breaking meat apart, until beef is lightly browned but not crisp, 6–8 minutes. Remove beef from pot.  
3. Cook pancetta in pot over medium heat, until it has released some of its fat and is crisp, 6–8 minutes.  
4. Add onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and begin to stick, 6–8 minutes.  
5. Return beef to pot and pour in the wine. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until wine is evaporated, 12–15 minutes. Meat should be broken up into little bits.  
6. Add tomato paste, bay leaf, and nutmeg. Cook until tomato paste is slightly darkened, about 5 minutes.  
7. Pour stock and milk into pot, add a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, 2–2.5 hours. Should look like sloppy joe mixture at the end. Remove bay leaf and adjust seasoning.  
8. Cook the pasta and combine with the sauce, the parmesan, and some of the cooking liquid.
